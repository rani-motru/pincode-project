      <p className='text'>India Post is a government-operated postal system in India, and is the trade name of the Department of Post under the
         Ministry of Communications. Generally known as the Post Office, it is the most widely distributed postal system in 
         the world. Warren Hastings had taken initiative under East India Company to start the Postal Service in the 
         country in 1766. It was initially established under the name "Company Mail". It was later modified into a service
         under the Crown in 1854 by Lord Dalhousie. Dalhousie introduced uniform postage rates (universal service) and helped
          to pass the India Post Office Act 1854 which significantly improved upon 1837 Post Office act which had introduced 
          regular post offices in India. It created the position Director General of Post for the whole country.</p>
